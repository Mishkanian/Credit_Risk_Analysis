# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. With the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, several different algorithms are used to predict credit risk. The performance of these different models are evaluated and recommendations are suggested based on the results.

## Software
- Python 3.7
- SciPy 1.6.2
- Scikit-learn 0.24.1
- imbalanced-learn 0.80
